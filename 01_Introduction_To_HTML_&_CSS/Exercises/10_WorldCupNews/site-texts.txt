The biggest scoreline in the history of the FIFA World Cup qualifiers - and indeed in the history of international football - was recorded on 11 April 2001, when Australia beat American Samoa 31-0.

This legendary match also brought global renown for Archie Thompson, whose 13-goal haul set a new world record, which stands to this day, for an individual player in a single international match.
